Hi! My name is Konstantina and I am a PhD candidate at the [Business Analytics Laboratory](https://www.balab.aueb.gr/) of the Athens University of Economics & Business. I am interested in all aspects of data science and applications of machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on machine learning models and methods that ”understand” source code and predict its properties.
