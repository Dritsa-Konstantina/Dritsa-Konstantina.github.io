**About Me**

Welcome to my page! My name is Konstantina and these are a few things about me...

* I am a PhD candidate at the [Business Analytics Laboratory](https://www.balab.aueb.gr/) of the [Athens University of Economics & Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en) in Greece. My advisor is Assoc. Prof. [Panagiotis Louridas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louridas).
* My research interests include all aspects of data science and applications of machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on machine learning models and methods that ”understand” source code and predict its properties.
* I have worked in the industry in the fields Data Journalism for [iMEdD.org](https://lab.imedd.org/en/lab-author/konstantina-dritsa-en/) as well as deep learning applications on source code for [bloop.ai](https://bloop.ai/).

Further in life...
* I love St Vincent (musician), zombie movies, Fyodor Dostoevsky, BBQ ribs, palm trees, my friends and family.
* I hate discriminations, pandemics and wars.
* I can't live without my portable speakers, which was a gift from my former colleagues at [Fantasy Travel](https://www.fantasytravelofgreece.com/).
* If I were an animal, I like to think I'd be a honey badger (small, fierce, persistent).
* My little sister is my hero.
* I get my research motivation mostly from reading good papers.
* The universe always fascinates me.
